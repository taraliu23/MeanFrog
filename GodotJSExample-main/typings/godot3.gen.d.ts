         *  By default, the thread group is [constant PROCESS_THREAD_GROUP_INHERIT], which means that this node belongs to the same thread group as the parent node. The thread groups means that nodes in a specific thread group will process together, separate to other thread groups (depending on [member process_thread_group_order]). If the value is set is [constant PROCESS_THREAD_GROUP_SUB_THREAD], this thread group will occur on a sub thread (not the main thread), otherwise if set to [constant PROCESS_THREAD_GROUP_MAIN_THREAD] it will process on the main thread. If there is not a parent or grandparent node set to something other than inherit, the node will belong to the  *default thread group* . This default group will process on the main thread and its group order is 0.  
         *  During processing in a sub-thread, accessing most functions in nodes outside the thread group is forbidden (and it will result in an error in debug mode). Use [method Object.call_deferred], [method call_thread_safe], [method call_deferred_thread_group] and the likes in order to communicate from the thread groups to the main thread (or to other thread groups).  
         *  To better understand process thread groups, the idea is that any node set to any other value than [constant PROCESS_THREAD_GROUP_INHERIT] will include any child (and grandchild) nodes set to inherit into its process thread group. This means that the processing of all the nodes in the group will happen together, at the same time as the node including them.

# GodotJSExample
This project includes examples at different complexity levels, incrementally introducing and utilizing more engine features.

A prebuilt version of `Godot Editor` can be downloaded from [GodotJS-Build](https://github.com/ialex32x/GodotJS-Build/releases).

> [!NOTE]
> Run `npm i` in the project folder before opening it in godot editor.  
>   
> And, so far, `npx tsc` (or `npx tsc -w`) must be run on your side to make the changes to the scripts take effect, since all `.js` files are not included in this git repository.

## Snake 
A simple snake game. 
In this example, only a limited subset of Godot's features is utilized: 
* script lifetime callbacks (_ready, _process etc.)
* resource loader
* using primitive types (float, bool, string, StringName)
* export variables

## Audio Generator

This is an example originally from https://godotengine.org/asset-library/asset/526  

It utilizes [ZzFXM](https://keithclark.github.io/ZzFXM/) which is written in pure javascript to play a 8bit-ish sound without audio media files.
